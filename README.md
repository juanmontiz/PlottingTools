# PlottingTools
## Some useful tools and functions for making different types of plots (box plots, violin plots, etc.).

- The box (violin) and swarm **palettes can be different**! In case they are the same, the box (violin) palette is set to be more translucid than the swarm so that the points can be clearly seen.
- Also, a custom palette can be provided.
- The arrays can have different numbers of elements.
- The code has to be executed twice for the **font_scale** to take effect (the ghosts in the machine...).
- If saveplot=True, the plot is saved in PNG, PDF, and SVG formats. Provide the filename **without extension**.
